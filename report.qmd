Introduction (Team Member 1, Team Member 2)

Background

Flight delays are undeniably one of the most frustrating aspects of travel, particularly for college students balancing tight schedules. Juggling academic responsibilities, social commitment, and possibly part time jobs or internships already leaves us with precious little time to space. Despite airline’s marketing and promises of efficiency and punctuality, timely arrivals and departures often seem to elude us during peak travel seasons. Exploring the various factors influencing flight delays, including weather conditions, airport congestion, and airline operations, could provide great insight into this persistent challenge. As a result, we decided to investigate this issue further, utilizing the January Flight Delay Prediction dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). This comprehensive dataset specifically focuses on January 2019 Ontime flight information, offering us an opportunity to analyze patterns and potentially develop strategies to better anticipate delays. For college students with limited flexibility in our schedules, understanding these patterns could significantly improve our travel experiences and help us make more informed decisions about when and how to plan our journeys.

Our Dataset

As mentioned before, the January Flight Delay Prediction dataset originates from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), specifically focusing on the January 2019 Ontime dataset. This comprehensive dataset contains 583,985 rows and 21 columns (583,985 observations and 21 variables) related to flight information and delay patterns. The variables are as follows:

DAY_OF_MONTH - day of month on which the flight occurred

DAY_OF_WEEK - day of week on which the flight occurred

OP_UNIQUE CARRIER - a unique code assigned to the operating airline

OP_CARRIER_AIRLINE_ID - a unique numerical ID for the operating airline

OP_CARRIER - the operating carrier code

TAIL_NUM - the tail number of the aircraft, unique for each plane

OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM - the flight number assigned by the operating carrier

ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID - a unique numerical ID for the origin airport

ORIGIN_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID - a sequential ID for the origin airport

ORIGIN - the IATA code for the origin airport

DEST_AIRPORT_ID - a unique numerical ID for the destination airport

DEST_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID - a sequential ID for the destination airport

DEST - the IATA code for the destination airport

DEP_TIME - the scheduled departure time for the flight

DEP_DEL15 - a binary indicator showing whether the flight departure was delayed by 15 minutes or more (0 = not delayed, 1 = delayed)

DEP_TIME_BLK - the scheduled departure time block, broad categories

ARR_TIME - the scheduled arrival time of the flight

ARR_DEL15 - a binary indicator showing whether the flight arrival was delayed by 15 minutes or more (0 = not delayed, 1 = delayed)

CANCELLED - a binary indicator showing whether the flight was cancelled (0 = not cancelled, 1 = cancelled)

DIVERTED - a binary indicator showing whether the flight was diverted to an alternate airport (1 = yes, 0 = no)

DISTANCE - the distance between the origin and destination airport

Our Question

Our primary research question is: What factors contribute to airline departure delays, and can we accurately predict a delay of 15 minutes or more using information available prior to departure?

Data Cleaning (Team Member 3)

To prepare for our predictive modeling of flight delays, we needed to clean and format our dataset. After carefully evaluating the original dataset containing 583,985 observations and 21 variables, we identified which features would be most useful for our analysis and which might interfere with model accuracy. With this goal in mind, we selected key variables that would be known prior to departure and dropped those that were redundant, irrelevant, or would create data leakage in our predictive models. The summary statistics of our original dataset revealed the range and distribution of variables such as departure times, flight distances, and our target variable DEP_DEL15 (indicating whether a flight was delayed by 15 minutes or more).

We focused our cleaned dataset on the following variables:

DAY_OF_WEEK: Day of week on which the flight occurred

DAY_OF_MONTH: Day of month on which the flight occurred

OP_CARRIER: The operating carrier code

ORIGIN: The IATA code for the origin airport

DEST: The IATA code for the destination airport

DEP_TIME: The scheduled departure time for the flight

DEP_TIME_BLK: The scheduled departure time block

DISTANCE: The distance between origin and destination airports

DEP_DEL15: Our target variable indicating whether departure was delayed (1) or not (0)

We also removed rows with missing values using na.omit() to ensure data quality. To improve model performance and prevent overfitting, we reduced the factor levels for certain categorical variables (ORIGIN, DEST, and OP_CARRIER) by keeping only the top 10 most frequent values and grouping the rest as "OTHER."

{r}
# Load the dataset
flight_data <- read.csv("/Users/samihamdalla/Desktop/dsmlProject/AirplaneDelays_MachineLearning/Dataset/Jan_2019_ontime.csv")


# Data cleaning - select relevant features from our cleaned dataset
flight_clean <- flight_data[c("DAY_OF_WEEK", "DAY_OF_MONTH", "OP_CARRIER", "ORIGIN", 
                             "DEST", "DEP_TIME", "DEP_TIME_BLK", "DISTANCE", "DEP_DEL15")]

# Remove rows with NA
flight_clean <- na.omit(flight_clean)

# Reduce factor levels to top 10 for better performance
top_origin <- names(sort(table(flight_clean$ORIGIN), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10])
flight_clean$ORIGIN <- ifelse(flight_clean$ORIGIN %in% top_origin, flight_clean$ORIGIN, "OTHER")

top_dest <- names(sort(table(flight_clean$DEST), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10])
flight_clean$DEST <- ifelse(flight_clean$DEST %in% top_dest, flight_clean$DEST, "OTHER")

top_carrier <- names(sort(table(flight_clean$OP_CARRIER), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10])
flight_clean$OP_CARRIER <- ifelse(flight_clean$OP_CARRIER %in% top_carrier, flight_clean$OP_CARRIER, "OTHER")

# Summary statistics
summary(flight_data)

From the summary statistics, we can observe that approximately 17.4% of flights experienced delays (mean of DEP_DEL15 = 0.174), making this a somewhat imbalanced classification problem that we'll need to address in our modeling approach.

Additionally, we properly converted all categorical variables to factors to ensure appropriate handling in our models:

DAY_OF_WEEK

DAY_OF_MONTH

OP_CARRIER

ORIGIN

DEST

DEP_TIME_BLK

DEP_DEL15 (our target variable)

{r}
flight_clean$DAY_OF_WEEK <- as.factor(flight_clean$DAY_OF_WEEK)
flight_clean$DAY_OF_MONTH <- as.factor(flight_clean$DAY_OF_MONTH)
flight_clean$OP_CARRIER <- as.factor(flight_clean$OP_CARRIER)
flight_clean$ORIGIN <- as.factor(flight_clean$ORIGIN)
flight_clean$DEST <- as.factor(flight_clean$DEST)
flight_clean$DEP_TIME_BLK <- as.factor(flight_clean$DEP_TIME_BLK)
flight_clean$DEP_DEL15 <- as.factor(flight_clean$DEP_DEL15)

Our Chosen Approaches

With our data cleaned and our response variable (DEP_DEL15) defined as binary (0 = no delay, 1 = delay), we shifted our focus toward identifying the most appropriate models for classification. Since we are not predicting a continuous outcome, regression models like linear regression were not suitable. Instead, we selected four classification models that would allow us to predict the likelihood of a flight delay and analyze the most influential predictors: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

First thing's first, divide data into training and test:

{r}
# Split into training (80%) and test set (20%)
library(caret)
set.seed(42)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(flight_clean$DEP_DEL15, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
train_data <- flight_clean[trainIndex, ]
test_data <- flight_clean[-trainIndex, ]

# Address class imbalance
library(ROSE)
balanced_train <- ROSE(DEP_DEL15 ~ ., data = train_data, seed = 123)$data

Our Methods

Logistic Regression Model

Why We Chose this Model

We began with logistic regression as our baseline classification model because it is widely used for binary classification problems and provides clear interpretations of predictor coefficients. Logistic regression models the probability of a flight being delayed based on a logistic function and is especially useful when the relationship between predictors and the log-odds of the response is approximately linear.

Our Formula

In the given equation, $p$, represents the probability of a flight being delayed, $B_0$ represents the model intercept, and $B_i$ for $i=1,...,n$ represents the coefficients of the predictor variables, where:

$B_1$ represents the coefficient for DAY_OF_WEEK

$B_2$ represents the coefficient for OP_CARRIER

$B_3$ represents the coefficient for ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID

$B_4$ represents the coefficient for DEST_AIRPORT_ID

$B_5$ represents the coefficient for DEP_TIME_BLK

$B_6$ represents the coefficient for DISTANCE

So, the logistic regression model equation is expressed as:

$y = \frac{e^{B_0 + B_1(\text{DAY_OF_WEEK}) + B_2(\text{OP_CARRIER}) + B_3(\text{ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID}) + B_4(\text{DEST_AIRPORT_ID}) + B_5(\text{DEP_TIME_BLK}) + B_6(\text{DISTANCE})}}{1 + e^{B_0 + B_1(\text{DAY_OF_WEEK}) + B_2(\text{OP_CARRIER}) + B_3(\text{ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID}) + B_4(\text{DEST_AIRPORT_ID}) + B_5(\text{DEP_TIME_BLK}) + B_6(\text{DISTANCE})}}$

{r}
logistic_model <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ ., data = balanced_train, family = binomial)
summary(logistic_model)

# Splitting data into training/testing and running Logistic Regression 
# with selected predictors over 10 iterations

set.seed(42)
lg.error.rate <- numeric(10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  sample <- sample.int(n = nrow(flight_clean), size = round(0.80 * nrow(flight_clean)), replace = FALSE)
  train <- flight_clean[sample, ]
  test <- flight_clean[-sample, ]
  
  flight.glm <- glm(DEP_DEL15 ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK + OP_CARRIER + ORIGIN + 
                      DEST + DEP_TIME_BLK + DISTANCE,
                    data = train, family = "binomial")
  
  # To obtain error rate
  glm.pred <- predict(flight.glm, newdata = test, type = "response")
  yHat <- glm.pred > 0.5
  lg.cm <- table(test$DEP_DEL15, yHat)
  lg.error.rate[i] <- ((lg.cm[1,2] + lg.cm[2,1]) / sum(lg.cm))
  lg.error.rate[i]
}

# Output the mean test error
mean(lg.error.rate)

To evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability, we performed a 10-fold random train-test split using an 80/20 ratio. For each iteration, we trained a logistic regression model on 80% of the data and tested it on the remaining 20%. We recorded the test prediction error for each run, then calculated the mean across all 10 iterations. The resulting mean test error rate was approximately 17.39%, indicating that the model misclassified about 1 in every 6 flights on average. This level of accuracy reinforces that the logistic regression model provides a solid baseline for predicting flight delays.

Model Interpretation

Intercept

The intercept ($B_0$) is -3.032, which means that when all predictor variables are at their reference levels (i.e., when the day of the week, airline, airport, departure time block, and distance are at their baseline), the log-odds of a flight being delayed is -3.032. This suggests a relatively low probability of delay under these conditions, but this is just the baseline.

Significant Predictors

DAY_OF_WEEK: Days like Thursday (DAY_OF_WEEK4) increase the likelihood of delays, while Saturday (DAY_OF_WEEK6) reduces it

OP_CARRIER: American Airlines (OP_CARRIERAA) has a lower chance of delays, while JetBlue (OP_CARRIERB6) has a higher chance

ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID & DEST_AIRPORT_ID: Both airports have small positive coefficients, indicating a slight increase in delays based on the airport

DEP_TIME_BLK: Later departure times, like 10:00-11:00 AM (DEP_TIME_BLK1000-1059), significantly increase delays

DISTANCE: Longer flights have a small increased likelihood of delays

Further Analysis - Confusion Matrix

{r}
# Predict on test data
logistic_pred <- predict(logistic_model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
logistic_pred_class <- ifelse(logistic_pred > 0.5, 1, 0)
logistic_pred_class <- as.factor(logistic_pred_class)

# Confusion Matrix 
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(logistic_pred_class, test_data$DEP_DEL15)
print(conf_matrix)

The confusion matrix shows the following results:

True Negatives (TN): 79,714 flights were correctly predicted as not delayed.

False Positives (FP): 37,461 flights were incorrectly predicted as delayed when they were not.

False Negatives (FN): 7,314 flights were incorrectly predicted as not delayed when they actually were delayed.

True Positives (TP): 17,417 flights were correctly predicted as delayed.

From this, we can observe that our logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 68.45%, which is lower than the No Information Rate of 82.57%. This suggests that simply predicting the majority class (not delayed) would actually yield higher accuracy than our model. The Kappa value of 0.2597 indicates fair agreement beyond chance, but there's significant room for improvement.

The model demonstrates balanced sensitivity (68.03%) and specificity (70.43%), indicating it performs similarly at identifying both delayed and non-delayed flights. However, the positive predictive value of 91.60% for non-delayed flights versus the negative predictive value of 31.74% for delayed flights shows that the model is much better at correctly identifying non-delayed flights when it predicts them. This imbalance suggests that despite our efforts to address class imbalance with ROSE, the model still struggles with accurately predicting the minority class (delayed flights).

Tree-Based Models

Why We Chose this Model

We chose a decision tree classifier as an additional modeling approach due to its interpretability and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between flight attributes and delays. Unlike logistic regression, which assumes linear relationships between features and the target, decision trees can reveal key decision splits that lead to delays. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, so we applied pruning techniques and also experimented with ensemble methods like Random Forest to improve generalization.

Our Formula

DEP_DEL15 ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK + OP_CARRIER + ORIGIN + DEST + DEP_TIME_BLK + DISTANCE

Decision Tree Analysis

Using the rpart package in R, we constructed a classification tree to predict flight delays. The decision tree creates binary splits in the data based on feature values, recursively partitioning the data to maximize homogeneity in each resulting node.

{r}
library(tree)
# Load library
library(ROSE)

# Ensure target variable is a factor
train_data$DEP_DEL15 <- as.factor(train_data$DEP_DEL15)

# Apply ROSE to generate a balanced dataset
set.seed(42)  # for reproducibility
train_rose <- ROSE(DEP_DEL15 ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK + OP_CARRIER + ORIGIN + 
                   DEST + DEP_TIME_BLK + DISTANCE, 
                   data = train_data, seed = 42)$data

# Check class balance
table(train_rose$DEP_DEL15)

# Train the decision tree on the balanced ROSE data
tree_model <- tree(DEP_DEL15 ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK + OP_CARRIER + ORIGIN + 
                   DEST + DEP_TIME_BLK + DISTANCE, 
                   data = train_rose,
                   control = tree.control(nobs = nrow(train_rose), mindev = 0.001))

# Print the model summary
summary(tree_model)

# Set up storage for error rates
set.seed(42)
tree_error_rate <- numeric(10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  # Random 80/20 split
  sample <- sample.int(n = nrow(flight_clean), size = round(0.80 * nrow(flight_clean)), replace = FALSE)
  train <- flight_clean[sample, ]
  test <- flight_clean[-sample, ]
  
  # Train decision tree
  tree_model_iter <- tree(DEP_DEL15 ~ DAY_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK + OP_CARRIER + ORIGIN + 
                            DEST + DEP_TIME_BLK + DISTANCE,
                          data = train,
                          control = tree.control(nobs = nrow(train), mindev = 0.001))
  
  # Predict
  tree_pred_iter <- predict(tree_model_iter, newdata = test, type = "class")
  
  # Compute confusion matrix and error rate
  cm <- table(test$DEP_DEL15, tree_pred_iter)
  error <- sum(cm[row(cm) != col(cm)]) / sum(cm)
  tree_error_rate[i] <- error
}

# Mean test error across 10 iterations
mean(tree_error_rate)


In this section, we trained a decision tree model using a balanced dataset generated with the ROSE package to address class imbalance. We defined a formula using variables available prior to departure and set a low mindev threshold to allow deeper tree growth since our original tree only had terminal nodes that led to 0s (indicating no delays only). To evaluate model stability and generalization, we repeated the process ten times using random 80/20 train-test splits. For each iteration, we calculated the test error and finally reported the mean error rate across all runs to assess overall model performance.

{r}
# Make predictions on the test set
tree_pred <- predict(tree_model, newdata = test_data, type = "class")

print(tree_conf_matrix)

# Performance metrics
tree_accuracy <- tree_conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"]
tree_sensitivity <- tree_conf_matrix$byClass["Sensitivity"]
tree_specificity <- tree_conf_matrix$byClass["Specificity"]

cat("Accuracy:", tree_accuracy, "\n")
cat("Sensitivity:", tree_sensitivity, "\n")
cat("Specificity:", tree_specificity, "\n")


Tree structure

Just as note for the extra parameter we added: We set mindev = 0.001 in tree.control() to reduce the minimum deviance required for a split. This was necessary because the default setting stopped tree growth prematurely, resulting in only three terminal nodes. All these predicting a delay of 0. Lowering the threshold allowed the tree to explore deeper splits and uncover more meaningful patterns.

The decision tree visualization shows the hierarchical structure of our flight delay prediction model. The tree branches out from the root node at the top, making binary splits based on the most informative features in our dataset. Each internal node represents a decision point based on a specific variable (such as departure time, airline carrier, or airport), while the leaf nodes at the bottom indicate the final prediction outcomes (0 for no delay, 1 for delay).

{r}
# Prune the tree using cross-validation
cv_tree <- cv.tree(tree_model, FUN = prune.misclass)
plot(cv_tree$size, cv_tree$dev, type = "b", 
     xlab = "Tree Size", ylab = "Misclassification Rate", main = "CV for Tree Pruning")

# Select optimal size
optimal_size <- cv_tree$size[which.min(cv_tree$dev)]
cat("Optimal tree size:", optimal_size, "\n")

pruned_tree <- prune.misclass(tree_model, best = optimal_size)

# Predictions using pruned tree
pruned_pred <- predict(pruned_tree, newdata = test_data, type = "class")

# Confusion matrix for pruned tree
pruned_conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(pruned_pred, test_data$DEP_DEL15)
print(pruned_conf_matrix)

# Compare accuracy before and after pruning
cat("Comparison of accuracy before and after pruning:\n")
cat("Original tree accuracy:", tree_accuracy, "\n")
cat("Pruned tree accuracy:", pruned_conf_matrix$overall["Accuracy"], "\n")

Further Analysis - Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix for the decision tree model shows:

True Negatives (TN): 93,095 flights correctly predicted as not delayed

False Positives (FP): 645 flights incorrectly predicted as delayed when they weren’t

False Negatives (FN): 18,768 flights incorrectly predicted as not delayed when they were

True Positives (TP): 1,017 flights correctly predicted as delayed

The model achieved 82.9% accuracy, only slightly better than the No Information Rate of 82.57%. The sensitivity (true positive rate for class 0 – not delayed) was very high at 99.31%, meaning the model excelled at identifying flights that were not delayed. However, the specificity was extremely low at 5.14%, showing that it struggled to correctly identify flights that were actually delayed.

The Kappa statistic was just 0.0697, indicating very poor agreement beyond chance. These results suggest that while the model appears accurate overall, it is heavily biased toward the majority class (non-delayed flights) and performs poorly on the minority class (delayed flights). ### Pruning to Avoid Overfitting

To prevent our decision tree from capturing noise in the training data, we implemented cost-complexity pruning using cv.tree() with misclassification as the pruning criterion. The cross-validation curve was relatively flat, indicating that increasing the tree size beyond a certain point had little effect on prediction performance. The optimal tree size selected was 14 terminal nodes, which happened to match our original unpruned tree.

This implies that the tree did not overfit severely and already maintained a balanced complexity. The pruned tree retained the most informative splits while eliminating branches that contributed little to prediction accuracy.

The pruned tree retained the most informative splits while eliminating branches that contributed little to prediction accuracy. This resulted in a more generalizable model that performs better on unseen data.

{r}
# Visualize the decision tree
plot(tree_model, type = "uniform")  
text(tree_model, pretty = 0, cex = 0.5) 

Performance Metrics

Accuracy:

Unpruned Tree: 82.9%

Pruned Tree: 82.9%

Sensitivity (True Negative Rate for non-delayed flights):

Unpruned Tree: 99.31%

Pruned Tree: 99.31%

Specificity (True Positive Rate for delayed flights):

Unpruned Tree: 5.14%

Pruned Tree: 5.14%

Kappa (Agreement beyond chance):

Unpruned Tree: 0.0697

Since the pruned and unpruned trees yielded identical performance, we retained the pruned version for interpretability. However, the model’s severe imbalance in predictive power between classes remains a key limitation. Further work could involve balancing the training data using resampling techniques to improve detection of delayed flights.

Random Forest Model

Why We Chose this Model

Random Forest was selected as our third classification model due to its ability to reduce overfitting and capture complex patterns by combining multiple decision trees. As an ensemble method, it builds a "forest" of decision trees using bootstrapped samples and random feature subsets, leading to more robust and generalizable predictions. This model helps mitigate the limitations of a single decision tree by aggregating predictions and lowering variance.

Balanced Accuracy: 65.82%

Interpretation

The Random Forest model performed better than the logistic regression and decision tree models in balancing sensitivity and specificity. It showed substantial improvement in identifying delayed flights compared to the decision tree while maintaining good performance in detecting non-delayed flights.

While its overall accuracy (69.35%) is slightly higher than that of logistic regression (68.45%), Random Forest achieved more balanced classification across both classes, particularly improving specificity (60.4%) versus the very low specificity (8.6%) of the decision tree. This makes Random Forest a more practical model for flight delay prediction.

The variable importance plot highlights the most influential factors in predicting delays, providing actionable insights. Notably, departure time block, origin and destination airports, and distance play major roles in influencing delay likelihood.

Enhancing our Model

While our initial Random Forest model showed promising results compared to logistic regression and decision trees, there were several important limitations we aimed to address through enhancements. The original model struggled with the class imbalance present in our dataset, where only about 17% of flights were delayed. Even after applying resampling techniques like ROSE, the model still favored the majority class, resulting in poor performance when identifying actual delays. To improve its sensitivity to delayed flights, we adjusted the classification threshold to better capture the minority class. Additionally, the original model used only a basic set of variables, missing important patterns such as time-of-day trends, weekend effects, and route-specific behaviors. To give the model more predictive power, we engineered new features including the hour of departure, a weekend indicator, and a combined route variable from origin and destination.

We also fine-tuned key hyperparameters such as the number of trees, the number of features considered at each split, and the minimum number of samples in a terminal node. These adjustments helped reduce overfitting and improved the model’s generalization to unseen test data. To enhance interpretability, we enabled feature importance scoring, which allowed us to identify that variables like departure time block, route, and distance had the greatest impact on predicting delays. By combining better feature engineering, smarter sampling strategies, and thoughtful threshold adjustment, the enhanced Random Forest model achieved significantly better balance between precision and recall. This made the model not only more accurate but also more practical and reliable for real-world use cases like travel planning and airline operations.

High Overall Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 81.64%, meaning it correctly predicted delay status for over 4 out of every 5 flights in the test set.

Good Sensitivity and Specificity: With Sensitivity at 83.41%, the model is strong at identifying flights that are not delayed, while a Specificity of 73.28% shows improved performance in detecting actual delays compared to previous models.

High Precision, Moderate Recall for Delays: The Positive Predictive Value (Precision) for non-delayed flights is 93.67%, indicating that most flights predicted as on-time truly were. However, the Negative Predictive Value (for delayed flights) is 48.24%, suggesting the model still misses over half of actual delays.

Balanced Performance Across Classes: The Balanced Accuracy is 78.34%, showing the model maintains reasonable performance for both delayed and non-delayed classes, especially in the presence of class imbalance.
